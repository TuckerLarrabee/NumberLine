## Using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and/or jQuery, create a number line with two draggable points. Similar to
the image shown above, the number line should have:
- A horizontal line with 11 tick marks labeled from -5 to 5.
- Have two points that are draggable along the horizontal line. The user should not be able to
drag the points off of or outside of the horizontal line.
- The user cannot drag and place the points in between two tick marks. Instead, points will snap
to the closest tick mark.
- Highlight the area between the two points with a bold line.
